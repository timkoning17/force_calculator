### force calculator

Use the 'forces_swing_angle' function to compute normal forces on the wheel as a function of swing arm angle, based on the parameters of the robot object

Use the 'assess_parameter' function to compute normal forces on the wheel as a function of swing arm angle, over a range of a second variable. The value range is symmetrical, meaning that a range of 'x' will result in -x to +x of your robot object value of the paramter.
